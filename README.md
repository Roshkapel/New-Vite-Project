# React + Vite

This Vite application is an update to an existing applicatio that had outdated dependencies.
The application was created with React and D3 to provide data visualization for sales professionals. Sales professionals and data analysts could create personal user profiles and access different parts of the program based
on neccessity and/or access level. The appliation was intended to provide sales forecasts to facilitate informed decision making and provide visual reports of data to observe sales trends.
Users could track their personal performance and use feature=s such as peak sales periods to increase efficacy of their sales efforts.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
